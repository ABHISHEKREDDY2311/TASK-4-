TASK 4
STEP 1: imported all the required libraries such as pandas ,numpy,sklearn,matplotlib etc
STEP 2: loaded the dataset and understanded the dataset
STEP 3: using train_test_split method splitted the data into training and testing and used standardscalar() for standardization
STEP 4: trained a logistic regression model with the dataset and predict on  test data
STEP 5: evaluation of model performance using confusion matrix,classification report and other specified means of ways
STEP 6: tuned threshold using sklearn library
STEP 7: plotted sigmoid function using numpy,matplotlib libraries , sigmoid function converts any number into a value between 0 and 1 â€” like a probability.
